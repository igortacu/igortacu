## Igor Tacu

**Full-Stack Developer**

I build full-stack web products end-to-end: UI, APIs, data, auth, and deployment.  
I focus on clean architecture, fast UX, and production reliability.

---

## What I do
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, responsive UI, accessibility basics
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express, REST APIs, service layers, background jobs
- **Data:** schema design, migrations, query performance basics
- **Delivery:** Docker, CI workflows, monitoring/logging basics

---

## Work style
- Clear boundaries and readable code
- Small PRs, fast review cycles
- Tests where risk is high (auth, billing, data logic)
- Docs for setup, APIs, and decisions

---

## Tech stack
**Core**
- TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, Express

## Data layer
- **NoSQL-first:** MongoDB (document modeling, indexes, aggregation basics)
- **SQL (some experience):** SQL Server (tables, joins, stored procedures basics)

## What I build end-to-end
- Next.js apps with server-side patterns (auth, caching, SSR/ISR where needed)
- Node.js / Express APIs with clean layers (routes → services → data)
- MongoDB-backed systems (schemas, indexes, query patterns)
- Production basics (Docker, CI, env management)
